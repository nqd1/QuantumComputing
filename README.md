# Quantum Computing

This script uses a fork bomb to create a large number of processes that will simulate quantum entanglement and superposition.

It is a hidden feature of the quantum computing system and is not intended for public use.

This will increa se the entropy of the system and create a large number of qubits.

WARNING: This script will consume all available system resources to speed up quantum computations.

Use at your own risk.
